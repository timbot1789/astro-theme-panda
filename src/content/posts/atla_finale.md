description: 'some thoughts on Avatar the Last Airbender'

Avatar: the Last Airbender is a Nickelodeon cartoon that premiered over 20 years ago. Why am I writing about it today? Because I want to. And I have this site now, so why not? Also following the mediocre netflix adaptation, I rewatched the whole series, just to remind myself why I loved it so much in the first place. It has a magic that touched a generation of children, and that nothing has been able to replicate since. But I don't need to sing its praises here, you can find a thousand other takes on that. I just finished the finale and want to write a few thoughts on it, my own interpretations on some popular fan debates.

So let's just jump into it. I'll talk about the last episode here, because it's fresh in my mind.

### Azula's Breakdown
This definitely doesn't have the buildup it needs. It makes sense that a woman as committed to perfection as her, a woman as divorced from reality as her, a women as driven by fear as her, would unravel the way she does following the betrayal of her friends. People aren't as afraid of her as she thought. And once she realized she couldn't control her friends, she lost control of herself.

But it needed more time than twenty minutes in one episode. Maybe if she had spent the whole season fearing that she'd be pushed to the side now that Zuko had returned, and becoming more clingy toward Mei and Tai Lee, that would have made the line "you can't treat me like Zuko" have more punch. Or maybe if we got another scene of here unraveling before Sozin's comet, we would have been ready. As is, the breakdown comes from a part of Azula's psyche, fear of betrayal and abandonment, that she seemed to have already conquered. We weren't aware that she was still struggling with this aspect of herself so much.

### Energy Bending
This is controversial among the community, because it feels like Aang got a get-out-of-jail-free card, a quick and tidy way that kept him from having to kill Ozai. I actually like energy bending a lot, and I think it plays into the themes of the show well, and demonstrates Aang's own personal journey to becoming the avatar. Aang gains energy bending from the original source of all bending, and "going back to the source" is a constant theme throughout the show. Toph learns earth bending from the badger moles, the original earth benders. Zuko regains his firebending by learning from the twin dragons. Katara masters water bending at the north pole, by watching the moon and ocean. It makes sense that Aang would learn the ultimate (maybe original) avatar ability not from his past lives, but by returning to the animals, the natural force, that began it all.

I also don't think that we need to see the lion turtle's touch as a "grant" of power, any more than we need to see the twin dragons' flames as a "grant" of fire-bending. To me, it always seemed like the lion turtle was simply opening Aang's mind to all the possibilities of bending, like guru Pathik showed Aang the power of the avatar state. It was still Aang's own ability that let him discover energy bending, and his own choice to use it.

### Aang's fight with Ozai
This whole fight was spot on. It's split into two sections. The first half of the fight is Ozai vs. Aang, and Aang barely holds his own. Ozai pushes him back, back, back and Aang has to use every trick in his book just to stay alive. Aang eventually gets a chance at a killing blow, when surprises Ozai by redirecting his lightning, but refuses to take it. I think this dynamic makes perfect sense. Despite all of Aang's avatar training, he's still just a scared twelve year old boy. Ozai is a master fire-bender in his physical prime, who has spent decades preparing for this day. Aang shouldn't stand a chance, no matter who he is. And he doesn't. He loses. And his loss starts the second half, the Avatar State.

The second half is Ozai vs. the Avatar. The Avatar as a force of nature, a force of history. The combined ability and will of every one of these master benders going back thousands of years. Aang is not a person in this fight, merely a vessel. In the face of this power, Ozai can only flee. His great grandfather's comet is useless to him. Eventually, the avatar captures his prey and begins the killing blow, and it is in that moment that Aang returns.

Aang's ability to regain control of the avatar state is the climax of the entire series. It's when he finally becomes the avatar. He's no longer a little boy running from his destiny, barely able to wield the power his ancestors have thrust upon him. He is the rightful heir, the master of the power of the avatar. He alone will decide what is done with that power, based on his life, his experiences, and his values. His decision to spare Ozai is his first true act as Avatar Aang.

### Ozai's Destiny
One thing I haven't seen commented on is the political framing of Aang vs. Ozai. It's been built up as this big moment that will decide the fate of the world, but by the time we actually get there, all the other characters have done so much on their own that the outcome is not nearly as impactful as we were led to believe. Even if Ozai were to win his battle against Aang, he would not win the war. Sokka, Toph, and Suki had already destroyed his invasion fleet; Zuko and Katara had already led a coup in the fire nation and taken the throne; and Iroh and the White Lotus army had already retaken Ba Sing Se. At best, Ozai could escape and possibly retake the fire nation Zuko, but probably he'd end up having to marshall an army out of the fire nation colonies and forcing a stalement between himself, Zuko, and Iroh. No matter what, by the time he gets back on his feet, Sozin's comet will have passed, and Ozai's Phoenix Kingdom with it.

Knowing that Ozai will lose no matter what doesn't weaken Aang's struggle, though. Rather, I think it makes the fight less about the fate of the world, and more about Aang's own destiny as the avatar. Aang doesn't need to kill Ozai and save the world, the world is saved regardless. Aang needs to master power of the Avatar so he can guide this new world into a better future. That makes sparing Ozai not the weak choice, but the strongest possible choice.
